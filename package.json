I have started by renaming the default branch from `master` to `main`, and I created a new branch named [`update_solidity_0_8`](https://github.com/owanhunte/ethereum-solidity-course-updated-code/tree/update_solidity_0_8) which I'll be committing all the updated code to. As I make progress, I'll be merging this branch back into the `main` branch._",
